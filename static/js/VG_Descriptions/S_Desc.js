// <p>What do you do when you have a breakout album like 1000 Gecs? Remix, repackage, and milk your hits for all 
// they're worth.</p>

// <p>Call it the Lil Nas Xification of the music industry (after Lil Nas X released three remixes of his breakout hit 
//     "Old Town Road"), 100 Gecs is bringing back the songs that made them famous, only bigger, badder, and much more
//     Gec than before.</p>

// <p>The original album, 1000 Gecs, was my album of the year in 2019. While it definitely wasn't the most 
// accessible album, often decomposing into unlistenable distortion just for the lols, at its core, 1000 Gecs was 
// full of uneniably catchy,
// hard-hitting melodies. 100 Gecs' uncompromising vision of glitchy, hyperpop mixed with all the genres under the
// rainbow was a stunning standalone success. There was something genius below all the memes.</p>

// <p>Meanwhile, the genius of Tree of Clues lies in stretching its source material to absurd extremes.
// The electronic hyperspeed 'hand crushed by a mallet' is now an angsty Fallout Boy alternative rock banger.
// The cute, quirky 'ringtone' is now a cypher-style posse cut featuring Rico Nasty. The glitchy, distorted
// xXXi_wud_nvrstop_UXXx is now the turbocharged dance club banger it apparently was always destined to be.
// ALL OF THESE CHANGES MAKE SENSE and refresh the source material in ways that were previously unimaginable.
// </p>

//     <p>100 Gecs' debut album 1000 Gecs very well may have been a fluke. Going for a remix album as opposed
//     to risking a sophomore slum with new material was likely a calculated decision, and one I don't disagree
//     with. Be that as it may, the community of artists that have gravitated around their sound shows that their
//     influence is only continuing to grow.</p>
