<p>Future Nostalgia</p>

<p>I'd like to think that over the years that I've become a "Poptimist" - a hipster that believes
that pop music can be good. I'd also like to
think that Pop music has gotten a lot more creative and inventive in the past few years.
In a genre where labels are machine-learning formulas algorithms to create hits
for the least common denominator, you worry that pop music is more focused on the end result
(selling records and topping the charts) as opposed to the quality of the end product.</p>

<p>Dua Lipa's 'Future Nostalgia' is formulaic, but in a way that closely studies
what makes pop music great as opposed to blindly following the algorithm. Take the single 'Physical'
for instance. It sounds like the beat from Britney Spears' 'Toxic' mixed with an anthemic chorus
that sounds like Lady Gaga, all while paying homage to Olivia Newton-John's 80's original hit. 
It's nothing really new, but 'Future Nostalgia' just feels 10x more refreshing than any other 
pop album on the market.</p>

<p>It doesn't hurt that the production BUMPS. Whether it's the turbocharged bass on
'Physical' or the frozen-in-time Darth Vaderesque strings on 'Love Again,' every production design
choice feels deliberate.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a lot of songs ('Pretty Please' and 'Good In Bed' especially) would benefit
tremendously if the hook was 20% better. So many songs are oh so close to being great which is my 
only real frustration with the album.</p>

<p>Overall, 'Future Nostalgia' isn't the greatest album of all time, but I am a fan.</p>

<p>PS: Idk what it says about me that my favorite songs are 'Physical' and 'Good In Bed.'
Don't read anything into this, Mom.</p>

<p>The New Abnormal</p>


<p>I am very late to the Strokes/Julian Casablancas party. I started paying attention when Julian Casablancas
(the former, now current lead singer of The Strokes) and his edgier rock band called The Voidz released their
2018 album 'Virtue'. I was struck by Julian's charismatic vocal delivery and the band's penchant for creating
epic vocal and instrumental moments on the album. I was sold.</p>

   <p>Fast forward to now, with Julian back with the chill vibes of The Strokes, we have a little more adventurous
   version of that classic Strokes sound. In short, imagine The Strokes, but with Julian often using his voice in a
   soaring, echo-y manner รก la The Killers at the end of "All These Things That I've Done".</p>

<p>Often, people might make fun of Radiohead fans for eating up every moan and mumble that lead singer
    Thom Yorke utters on the mic. While it's a hyperbolic statement, that's where I'm at with Julian Casablancas.
    You can have a nice Strokes backdrop with Julian riffing his heart away and I'm sold. That recipe works for me.</p>

    <p>I personally struggle with rating any type of chill rock music. I can't find glaring flaws in the way that I find
    them easier to spot in a hip-hop or pop album. It all sounds pretty good to me. That said, I'm loving this Strokes
    record and hopefully you might too.</p>

<p>1000 Gecs and the Tree of Clues</p>


<p>What do you do when you have a breakout album like 1000 Gecs? Remix, repackage, and milk your hits for all 
they're worth.</p>

<p>Call it the Lil Nas Xification of the music industry (after Lil Nas X released three remixes of his breakout hit 
    "Old Town Road"), 100 Gecs is bringing back the songs that made them famous, only bigger, badder, and much more
    Gec than before.</p>

<p>The original album, 1000 Gecs, was my album of the year in 2019. While it definitely wasn't the most 
accessible album, often decomposing into unlistenable distortion just for the lols, at its core, 1000 Gecs was 
full of uneniably catchy,
hard-hitting melodies. 100 Gecs' uncompromising vision of glitchy, hyperpop mixed with all the genres under the
rainbow was a stunning standalone success. There was something genius below all the memes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the genius of Tree of Clues lies in stretching its source material to absurd extremes.
The electronic hyperspeed 'hand crushed by a mallet' is now an angsty Fallout Boy alternative rock banger.
The cute, quirky 'ringtone' is now a cypher-style posse cut featuring Rico Nasty. The glitchy, distorted
xXXi_wud_nvrstop_UXXx is now the turbocharged dance club banger it apparently was always destined to be.
ALL OF THESE CHANGES MAKE SENSE and refresh the source material in ways that were previously unimaginable.
</p>

    <p>100 Gecs' debut album 1000 Gecs very well may have been a fluke. Going for a remix album as opposed
    to risking a sophomore slum with new material was likely a calculated decision, and one I don't disagree
    with. Be that as it may, the community of artists that have gravitated around their sound shows that their
    influence is only continuing to grow.</p>
