<p>Look, you had me sold at "Alien Abduction Concept Album". However, Uzi 
  doesn't add any sort of depth to the concept. While the songs are a little more
   refined than *cough cough* LUV vs. The World 2, that's not really saying anything.
   An awesome beat on 'Prices' can only go so far when Uzi is squealing "i JuSt WeNt 
   Up In My PrIcE" all over it. There are some decent, albeit fleeting moments and 
   the skits are fun. But I'm not seeing the hype.</p>

console.log('Against All Logic')

info.html(`<p>Against All Logic</p>
<p>2017-2019</p>

<p>"Against All Logic" is an alias for Nicolas Jaar, an EDM producer. Two years ago he produced
my favorite electronic record of the year (albeit faint praise given my limited EDM knowledge),
 "2012-2017." His instrumentals tend to have a slow build-up dance vibe, where it might take
 2-3 minutes to really understand what he's going for - think LCD Soundsystem, but with a couple
 of random vocal samples thrown in. Although his 5-7 minute songs are hit or miss, when it hits,
 like "2012-2017"'s 'Rave on U' and 'You Are Going to Love Me and Scream', man it really hits.</p>

 <p>My best experience with this album boils down to one moment. I was playing it in my car while
 driving home from work. My AUX cord was and continues to be broken for some reason, so I had
 my phone turned all the way up and bouncing off of the acoustics of my cupholder (you know, 
    the perfect audio conditions to capture the subtle nuances of an electronic album). Anyways,
    I thinking much of the album because I was focusing on, you know, the road, when on the
    third song I was pulled in by a distorted, intoxicating sample of The Sugarhill Gang's 
    "Rapper's Delight." Over and over you hear the chopped and screwed sample of "and you don't
    stop" "and you don't stop" "AnD yOu DoN'T sToPpp," murmuring as if it's in the back of an
    Uber after a long night of drinking. Once I got to a stoplight, I looked down at my phone
    and saw that the song is called "With An Addict," which makes sense given the overall vibe
    of the song. Kind of a fun realization after the fact. 


 <p>Compared to its predecessor, "2017-2019" is more experimental and choppy. I don't like it
 as much as "2012-2017" but it had some good moments so it's C-Tier.</p>

<p>I refuse to let '3.15.20s' all-white album cover ruin my tier-list aesthetics. I've never
gotten into Gambino as an artist and this album roll-out makes it hard. The full-on pretentiousness
of a blank album cover and refusing to name 80% of your songs in the name of art is low-key
insulting.</p>

<p>It's a decent album with some nice soul passages and wannabe Kanye impressions. He's matured
a lot from the days of 'Camp' and 'Before the Internet'. I really
like Donald's vivacity and energy on the last track. I would talk more about my favorite
tracks, but it's hard to differentiate between them because of their timestamp titles.
At least Kendrick Lamar's 'untitled unmastered' had songs listed 1,2,3 etc. Ughh....

<p>Legends Never Die</p>

<p>Look, I was pretty meh on this. I'm happy this exists. I'm happy that these feel like real Juice WRLD songs
and that his team took care trying to make this good. It feels good albeit weird and sad to be hearing new Juice
WRLD music. It's especially eerie when the content and imagery of his music continues to be his debilitating 
drug addiction and correctly predicting that these drugs will take his life.
</p>

<p>My album experience is basically synonymous to my experience of hearing 'Man of the Year' (the original version
  on YouTube, not the new version they replaced it with on Spotify) the first time. This
peppy, upbeat song is nice in a vacuum, but carried significant weight to me given that it felt like "the last great
Juice WRLD song." And ya, it hit me pretty damn hard.</p>

<p>So rather than dwell on this decent posthumous release, I'd rather think of this is a victory lap and an opportunity
to celebrate all of the happiness Juice's music brought into my life. With that, I'll finish this by listing my
 top 10 Juice WRLD songs.</p>

info.html(`<p>Drake</p>
<p>Dark Lane Demo Tapes</p>


<p>Going into this, I was skeptical. Drake's output can often sound generic and inconsistent. His last full release,
'Scorpion' definitely had some highlights, but was bloated with mediocre songs that should've been cut. Reading that
this new release consisted of songs that didn't make the cut for an upcoming album, I had low expectations.</p>

<p>And 'Dark Lane Demo Tapes' isn't without its flaws. Its lead single is 'Toosie Slide' a song manufactured to 
generate a Tik Tok dance craze and serve no other purpose. It is one of my three least favorite songs this year.
The Playboi Carti on 'Pain 1993' is as bad as Future on 'King's Dead' without a quarter of the memeability. 'War' is
a decent song, but Drake's Jamaican-sounding delivery is goofy and diminishes the value of the track.</p>

<p>Much of the highlights follow the same formula as 'Do Not Disturb' from Drake's 'More Life'. Essentially, Drake
spends a lot of the album with the same deliberate paced flow reciting sad boy poetry one one-liner at a time.
"You sold me up the river but I rode back/ You put me on the road without a road map." ('Losses'). 
That sort of stuff.</p>

<p>And you know what? I'm fine with that. I'm here for sentimental-bars Drake. This tape will be forgotten relatively
soon, but it's enjoyable while it's on and is good quarantine fodder. If these are the B-Sides, my fingers are crossed
for a pretty good Drake album this summer.</p>

info.html(`<p>Joey Bada$$</p>
<p>The Light Pack</p>

<p>More like the "Aight Pack" amirite?</p>

<p>I love me some Joey Bada$$, and I wanted this to be great. And after releasing the <a href=https://twitter.com/joeyBADASS/status/1283458460760395777>
  greatest music video promo</a>
  that I have ever seen, I thought we were getting greatness. A Pusha T feature to boot? What is happening??</p>

  <p>Spoiler Alert: We didn't get greatness. I thought 'The Light' was pretty good. It follows the Joey Bada$$ formula
  pretty heavily, which isn't a bad thing, but also doesn't really indicate that this new project is going to be
  anything we haven't heard. The other two songs are just a little too lighthearted for me. In a way, I want him to
  branch out and grow, but I also think if the formula isn't broken, don't fix it.</p>

  <p>Part of what gave me minor qualms about Joey's last album, 'All Amerikkkan Bada$$,' was that it was pretty
  pop-friendly and sing-songy for an album with 3 consecutive Ks and a Bada$$ in the title. Joey has a unique,
  devastating delivery and while he has some versatility and ability to make more lighthearted songs, I feel like it
  strays away from his biggest strengths.</p>

  <p>That said, I will be listening to Joey's new album the day that it drops because I have season tickets to anything
  Joey and there's no way that it isn't
  Banger City, USA.</p>
