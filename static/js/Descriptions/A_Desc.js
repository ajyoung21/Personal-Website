info.html(`<p>Denzel Curry X Kenny Beats</p>
<p>UNLOCKED</p>


<p>I have season tickets to anything Denzel Curry and he definitely delivered here.
    While Denzel usually raps in a militant,
   triplet flow (flow = the rhythm that you rap your words in), Kenny Beats' swaying, side-to-side, boom-bap 
   production has Denzel adapting with an off-kilter flow that's historically dominated the New
   York scene.</p>

   <p>Kenny does a great job of supplementing any rests that Denzel takes. Whether it's
     Madvillainy-esque skits bookending the project or little vocal modifications here and
     there, Kenny sounds like a live-DJ who knows when to add sound effects and when to
     drop the beat and get the hell out of Denzel's way. </p>

     <p> Although "UNLOCKED" doesn't feature the grand scope and focus that made Denzel's
        2018 album, "TA1300", so good, (How could it? UNLOCKED was made in three days) this
        is the perfect mini-project to tide fans over to whatever's next.</p>

<p>After Hours</p>

<p>Abel Tesfaye (aka The Weeknd) hasn't ever been my jam. Sure, I'll like select singles like "The Hills" or
"Starboy," but the only time I listened to a Weeknd album front-to-back, (his 2016 album "Starboy")
I wasn't blown away.</p>

<p>While I'm not completely floored with this album, there are some very compelling moments
(Scared to Live and the title track to name a few) that propels this album above anything else 
I've heard this year. The Weeknd has leveled up his sound and songwriting.</p>

<p>The album's biggest misstep is 'Snowchild,' where Abel Tesfaye reverts back to his old sound
and thinking that he can rap. "Stack a couple M's like I'm Shady"? 
"All my diamonds hitting like they Swae Lee"?? "Futuristic sex, give her Philip K Dick"???
Are these really your best BARS?? 
</p>

    <p>Still, 'After Hours' conveys genuine emotion and comes through with some of the best
    musical moments so far this year.</p>

<p>Future Nostalgia</p>

<p>I'd like to think that over the years that I've become a "Poptimist" - a hipster that believes
that pop music can be good. I'd also like to
think that Pop music has gotten a lot more creative and inventive in the past few years.
In a genre where labels are machine-learning formulas algorithms to create hits
for the least common denominator, you worry that pop music is more focused on the end result
(selling records and topping the charts) as opposed to the quality of the end product.</p>

<p>Dua Lipa's 'Future Nostalgia' is formulaic, but in a way that closely studies
what makes pop music great as opposed to blindly following the algorithm. Take the single 'Physical'
for instance. It sounds like the beat from Britney Spears' 'Toxic' mixed with an anthemic chorus
that sounds like Lady Gaga, all while paying homage to Olivia Newton-John's 80's original hit. 
It's nothing really new, but 'Future Nostalgia' just feels 10x more refreshing than any other 
pop album on the market.</p>

<p>It doesn't hurt that the production BUMPS. Whether it's the turbocharged bass on
'Physical' or the frozen-in-time Darth Vaderesque strings on 'Love Again,' every production design
choice feels deliberate.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a lot of songs ('Pretty Please' and 'Good In Bed' especially) would benefit
tremendously if the hook was 20% better. So many songs are oh so close to being great which is my 
only real frustration with the album.</p>

<p>Overall, 'Future Nostalgia' isn't the greatest album of all time, but I am a fan.</p>

<p>PS: Idk what it says about me that my favorite songs are 'Physical' and 'Good In Bed.'
Don't read anything into this, Mom.</p>

<p>The New Abnormal</p>


<p>I am very late to the Strokes/Julian Casablancas party. I started paying attention when Julian Casablancas
(the former, now current lead singer of The Strokes) and his edgier rock band called The Voidz released their
2018 album 'Virtue'. I was struck by Julian's charismatic vocal delivery and the band's penchant for creating
epic vocal and instrumental moments on the album. I was sold.</p>

   <p>Fast forward to now, with Julian back with the chill vibes of The Strokes, we have a little more adventurous
   version of that classic Strokes sound. In short, imagine The Strokes, but with Julian often using his voice in a
   soaring, echo-y manner รก la The Killers at the end of "All These Things That I've Done".</p>

<p>Often, people might make fun of Radiohead fans for eating up every moan and mumble that lead singer
    Thom Yorke utters on the mic. While it's a hyperbolic statement, that's where I'm at with Julian Casablancas.
    You can have a nice Strokes backdrop with Julian riffing his heart away and I'm sold. That recipe works for me.</p>

    <p>I personally struggle with rating any type of chill rock music. I can't find glaring flaws in the way that I find
    them easier to spot in a hip-hop or pop album. It all sounds pretty good to me. That said, I'm loving this Strokes
    record and hopefully you might too.</p>

It was a long, arduous process in which I had to dig deep into my brain to search for how
I felt about an album that I had listened to several months prior. I wanted to do an end-of-year
update to the list, but it was just too big of an undertaking (In short: 1. 1000 Gecs, 2. Juice WRLD 
3. Billie Eilish, the Lana album was aight.) </br></br>
I want to make this a living, breathing document that I add to whenever I have an opinion on an
album. Think something like the Constituation, but people actually respect it and only my grandma
reads it.
</br></br>
I do not claim to be the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/theneedledrop">Internet's Busiest 
Music Nerd.</a> Some of these albums I'm just going to listen to once. I may crap on your
favorite album. I will be inconsistent. I may rate Billie Eilish too high (except I didn't and can
mathematically prove
that her album was better than Ariana Grande's album last year). It's nothing personal. Let me know if
you have any thoughts. I plan to keep adding to this page and possibly making more interactive
features depending on how much react.js I learn. Check it out!
