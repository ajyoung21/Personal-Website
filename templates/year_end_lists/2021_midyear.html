     <p>Last post, I predicted that 2021 would be loaded music-wise. Yeah...didn't happen, at least not yet.</p>

       <p>Maybe ths system is still revving up. Maybe I'm not paying enough attention. Maybe Kendrick Lamar and the TDE 
         conglomerate all retired and didn't tell anyone. The flood gates will open at some point, just not yet. 
       </p>

       <p>Still, there were a few gems and big releases worth writing about to go along with some NBA angst, as well as 
         one of the greatest album covers of all time, so here we are! Feel free to skim and scroll through for my luke-warm 
         takes!

     <center><p><h2>2021 NBA Playoff Thoughts</h2></p></center>
              </br> 
              <p>Sure, the small-market Milwaukee Bucks eliminated the big bad Brooklyn Nets, but the war for 
                competitive equity in the NBA has long been lost. In the era of "player empowerment" where stars 
                cluster in big markets and force their way out of small markets, Milwaukee's struggles versus a 
                significantly injured Brooklyn team highlights how much has to go right for small markets to 
                hang with superteams. The Phoenix Suns had a similar breaktrough when LA Lakers star Anthony Davis 
                was sidelined with a groin injury and LeBron was hobbled with a bum ankle and Kawhi Leonard of the LA Clippers 
                hurt his knee. The glass cieling may only 
                be broken by injuries.
                </p>
        
        <p>And it's just so far gone that I've chosen to give in. I started rooting for the villainous Nets. In a league where 
          king-making superstars LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, and James Harden are all on their third 
          team, you can't boycott the player empowerers and expect to be happy with the outcome. I had to turn a blind eye and 
          just enjoy watching the 
          Nets be the greatest offense in NBA history. They're really fun and play smart basketball! I also still enjoy 
          watching Kawhi Leonard be a menace on both ends of 
          the floor even though he screwed over my favorite team, the San Antonio Spurs. What I don't enjoy; 
          watching Milwaukee star Giannis Antetokounmpo bricking ill-advised pull-up 3s and taking 15 seconds in between 
          free throw attempts - even if he is the torchbearer for small markets everywhere.
        </p>
        
        <p>So even in the most wide-open, small-market-friendly postseason that I can remember, I'm struggling to find 
          a team to rally behind (although the Atlanta Hawks are making quite the 
          Cinderella run). I realize you can only play the teams in front of you. However, am I supposed to believe that 
          the favored Bucks and Suns would've made the NBA Finals 
          without massive injury luck? As fun as the Hawks 
          winning the championship would be, would anyone take it seriously? The system is so broken that parity feels 
          like a glitch rather than a programmed outcome.
        </p>

        <p>But to be honest, I'm just glad the Lakers didn't win again lol.

            <a id="announcelist">Olivia Rodrigo - Sour</a></br>
              <img width="40%" src="../static/images/Blogs/2021/olivia.jpeg"> </center>

        </br>
        <p>I could continue my pessimistic energy from the previous segment, especially for an album centered around a bitter 
          break-up, but I actually enjoy a lot of what Olivia brings to the table.
            </p>

    <p>Sure, one could dismiss Sour on its face. On paper, Olivia is another product of the Disney-to-Radio pipeline 
            who wears a lot of her influences on her sleeve. The harmonies sound like Lorde. There's Billie Eilishisms 
            sprinkled throughout. It's Taylor Swift for the Tik Tok generation. 
            </p>
          
    <p>But what Olivia has that her predecessors don't is a freshly broken heart and the ability to turn that teenage 
      heartbreak up to 1000. Much of Sour revolves around Olivia's emotions after getting dumped by her high-school boyfriend 
      for a blonde girl. Whether it's the wrathful "good 4 u," to the passive-aggressive "deja vu," to the regretful 
      second-guessing "1 step forward, 3 steps back," to the about-to-cry-any-moment "driver's license," it's as if Olivia 
      is processing to seven stages of grief right in front of you. While I might not love every song here, I do appreciate 
      how Sour takes its concept and paints a portrait of what Olivia's mindset.
    </p>

    <p>And all that teenage melodrama feels more charming than cringey. My favorite song on the album, "favorite crime," 
      illustrates this best.
      While the song's premise (i.e. hoping her ex "enjoys" the heartbreak he criminally caused her) is a bit much, its 
      emotional climax wouldn't work if the breakup wasn't a big deal. Maybe it's the comfort of knowing that Olivia will 
      eventually get to a point where this stuff doesn't hurt so bad. Maybe it's the nostalgia of remembering when we all 
      were in a similar phase of teenage angst. Whatever it is, props to Olivia for a breakout album that a lot of people 
      are resonating with.

            <a id="announcelist">J Cole - The Off-Season</a></br>
            <img width="40%" src="../static/images/Blogs/2021/off_season.jpg"> </center>

    </br>

    <p>I've come full circle on J Cole. From growing up thinking he could be the GOAT, to being lukewarm on 2014 
      Hills Drive, to doing a <a href="https://postgradpalabras.wordpress.com/2018/07/09/mid-year-music-roundup/">
         cringey economic analysis</a> of KOD's flaws, to genuinely being excited for this project.
        </p>

<p>And after years of trying to do it all by himself, Cole is finally sticking to his strengths on "The Off-Season." 
  There are good beats, good to great features (Lil Baby!), good raps, and no 
  half-baked concepts. Cole is just focusing on the raps.
</p>

<p>And while this formula works, I feel mixed on the results. On one hand, it feels like Cole read my mind and 
  addressed every criticism 
  that I had 
  for KOD. Most of the songs here, especially on the second half, are pretty good. On the flip side, Cole's lack of development 
  as an artist is pretty glaring considering where he started. There are bars, there are fire verses, but there aren't the 3-5 
  GREAT songs you could expect on any Cole project early in his career. Maybe my expectations are unfair.
</p>

<p>"The Off-Season" reminds the world that Cole is really good at rapping. Mission accomplished. Yet while his technical ability has 
  gone up this album cycle, it's small potatoes at this point of Cole's career.

        BabyTron - LUKA TRONČIĆ</a>
         </center>


        <p>I know that we still have 85% of the decade left to go, but the race is over. The best album cover of the 2020s 
          is LUKA TRONČIĆ. The pun. The top-to-bottom color progression. The sunset and the moon at the same time. Crossing up the 
          pawns on the chess board. The strategically placed knight piece that looks like the Dallas Mavericks mascot but avoids 
          copyright infringement! My only complaint is that the beautifully stylized BabyTron signature fades into the 
          background. Give the signature an outer glow or a white outline and ship it off to the Smithsonian.
        </p>

          <p>Stylistically, my friend Mario and I first heard of BabyTron last night and we're still trying to figure out if 
            he's any good. BabyTron is part of an apparently up and coming Detroit rap scene which is off-beat by design 
            in an effort to cram as many syllables into each bar by possible. And by off-beat, I mean so off-beat he makes 
            Blueface (who has an album called "Find the Beat") sound like a metronome.
            </p>

            <p>But that's kind of the point. At times, its a repetitive onslaught, but other times, it's kinda catchy and 
              captivating. Case in point would be the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxwLD4qUKH4">
              IG Captions</a>. BabyTron keeps the flow tighter, ups his NBA one-liner game slightly, and the result has him 
              positively 
              floating over an awesome, bouncy instrumental. Throw in some nicely timed beat drops, some supporting background 
              vocals and you can really see how good this style can be when it's right.
          </p>

        <h3 style="font-size:260%">Poison - Global Dan (feat. Global AzN) (2018)</h3></a></a></br>
          <img width="40%" src="../static/images/Blogs/2021/poison.jpg"></center>
          <ol reversed>
          </br>
          <p>
              I'm not sure if Global Dan is a consistently good artist. Actually, I have a decent amount of 
              evidence suggesting that he isn't. 
              But having been roped into his discography by the Spotify algorithm, I'll say that he sometimes pulls 
              out some absolute 
              bangers with the occasional help from his 
              friend Global AzN. For more backhanded compliments, keep reading.
              </p>
      
              <p>On "Poison," Mr. Dan has a pretty good hook, but AzN steals the show on the first verse. One thing
                to know, AzN is only capable of speaking in clichés. However, the way he strings them together on this 
                verse is pretty clever. Even as he's generically sing-rapping about "switching lanes," "riding waves," 
                and "making plays," it's pretty clear that he's genuinely pouring his emotional struggle, his hopes 
                and aspirations, his everything into this single performance. It's a star-making performance dedicated to 
                the other lost souls drifting through the winds of the YouTube algorithm.
              </p>
      
              <p>And yes, Global Dan's cringey Lil Uzi Vert impression on the back end doesn't quite do AzN justice, but let's 
                stay backhandedly positive.
              </p>

              <p>"Poison" is the unapolegetic anthem of two burnouts on the eternal quest for modest internet stardom. There's 
                a slight existentialist edge to their live-fast, die-young, maybe-get-100k-subscribers mentality as we're not
                sure this is all going to work out. Be that as it may, the die is cast, the lanes are switched, and in the 
                now-immortal 
                words of Global AzN, "you can take my heart and run away but I won't chase it."

          Hooligan - Baby Keem</a></li>
            <img width="40%" src="../static/images/Blogs/2021/hooligan.jpg">
        </center>
      </br>
        <p>
        Baby Keem's upcoming album "The Melodic Blue," is my most/only anticipated album on the horizon. Keem has a blunt,
        deadpan delivery that shouldn't work on paper but is ironically good, veering towards unironically good. It's hard 
        to explain what makes his style work at times. 
        </p>

        <p>Hooligan is tightly focused and has a catchy, whistling beat that stays in your head. The range of outcomes for 
          this upcoming record feels pretty staggering. Maybe Keem's hits are flukes and this album is a boring 3-4/10. Maybe Keem 
          is a genius and it's a 9/10 and rap AOTY. So many possibilities!

          Mazza - Slowthai (feat. A$AP Rocky)</a></li>
            <img width="40%" src="../static/images/Blogs/2021/mazza.png">
        </center>
      </br>
      </br>
       

        <p>
          Mazza, short for "Mazzalean," is British slang for "madness" or general chaotic hooliganry. 
          It's a proper descriptor for British rapper Slowthai's generally herky-jerky rap style.
            </p>

            <p>That said, "Mazza" delves into Slowthai's past struggles with drugs and depression, perhaps fueling
              this destructive attitude. It's a personal story told in an entertaining way. A less troubled A$AP Rocky 
              comes in on the back end dripping with charisma in an awesome feature. A grades all around.
            </p>

              Eœ (Disk•Initiate) - Iglooghost</a></li>
                <img width="40%" src="../static/images/Blogs/2021/igloo.jpg">
            </center>
          </br>
         
          <p>Less song and more cinematic mood setter, "Eœ (Disk•Initiate)" conveys a rollercoaster of emotion without 
            saying a word. Imagine waking up on a new planet and emerging from your spaceship after a thousand years of 
            cryo-sleep. You open the hatch and step out of the airlock to a new planet brimming with life and endless 
            possibilities.
          </p>

          <p>It's that wondrous feeling of immersion and imagination that makes this track great. Things start harmoniously, 
            as soaring strings accentuate the beauty that you can feel around you. Yet just as you are settling in, the winds pick up, 
            there's a weird, swirling clicking sound, and you get a strange feeling that you aren't alone (whether that's good 
            or bad is unclear). 
            And then, just as you're about to reach the climax, the tension is
            corked, the disk is ejected, and the real world sets in. It's the ultimate tease on a hell of a teaser track.
          </p>
          
                
            <p>And sure, the rest of the album, Lei Line Eon, doesn't live up to the wonder of its first track. The 
              album's second track, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrkUW1kP9QQ">"Pure Grey Circle"</a> pulls it off, 
              and has the most hype first minute I've heard in a long time. Past that, the album gets somewhat bland 
              and stale. Maybe that's to be expected as more of the world is revealed and less is left to the imagination.
            </p>

            <p>But they can't take away the first two tracks from us :''') *re-ups Spotify subscription*
