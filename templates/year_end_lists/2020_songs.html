     <p>Ok, I lied, these objectively aren't the best songs of 2020. A more politically correct description would be 
       "My Favorite Songs of 2020" or "Weird, experimental alien noises that Alex listens to." But you
       wouldn't haven't clicked then, would've you?</p>

       <p>And objectively, 2020 hasn't been the best year for most people. You know the script. But in a year
         that's been so tough for so many people, I'm thankful that you took the time to briefly check this 
         out. Enjoy!

     <p><h2> The Worst Songs of 2020 In My Honest Opinion:</h2>

      <ol reversed>
      
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8">Yummy - Justin Bieber</a></li>
        <p>Idk, I just find the part where Justin says "yeah babe" repeatedly 
            to be pretty dang annoying. Subject matter isn't fun for anyone besides Justin. It wins the crown
            for annoying radio hit that was absolutely everywhere. But you know
          what, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IntBfu0tik8">Florida Georgia Line remix</a> is actually
        kinda hard even though the rap verses are hilariously absolute trash.</p>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWggTb45brM">Toosie Slide - Drake</a></li>
        <p>I get what you're trying to do here Drake. Drake + Tik Tok dance = Certified #1 hit. I just wish that 
          Drake's dance and song by extension weren't so low-effort. That's all. 
        </p>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AyMjyHu1bA">Intentions - Justin Bieber (feat. Quavo)</a></li>
        <p>Upon re-listening, this song isn't as painfully bland as I remember. Beat is kinda nice and 
          bubbly and it's not as long as I remember it. But man, some really cringey bars by Justin. 
          "Shout out to your mom and dad for making you."
          "You just got that ring. Just like Toronto." The Quavo feature feels tacky. Maybe it's not as 
          terrible as I'm making it seem, sorry Justin.
        </p>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VnY-DLybAs">Make Em Say - NLE Choppa (feat. Mulatto)</a></li>
        <p>Hands down the worst actual song I heard this year. The chorus is terrible and repetitive and lasts
          forever.
        </p>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kn0V5mpJe4">4 Da Trap - 645AR</a></li>
        <p>I listened to 10 seconds of this and hated it. My brother listened to 5 seconds and hated it.
          My dog listened to 2 seconds and started barking. That last part is too bad because 645AR's obscenely
          high pitched vocals indicate that my dog very well may be the target demographic for his music.</p>
        . <p>Look I get it, rapping is 
          a saturated market and he's just trying to have a gimmick to get on the map, but this isn't a 
          real attempt at music. The vocals aren't even on beat. It's utterly unlistenable and 645AR 
          must be stopped.
        </p>
      </ol>


      <p><h2>Favorite Music Video of 2020: The Strokes - At The Door</h2>
     <center> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9CAz_vvsK9M" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>
  <p>It's hard to rate music videos because A) I only watch music videos if I really like the song and 
    B) I have a dark, niche taste so I tend to skew for that aesthetic. "At The Door" nails both of these 
    with an added nostalgia factor by animating the video in an 80s animation style inspired by movies 
    like "Watership Down." I honestly forgot that this is really how kids movies were animated. Kind of 
    harrowing tbh.

  <p>Thoughts: RIP Juice WRLD. He had the #1 spot on my list before he passed and it's really sad to see a talented guy 
  whose music made me happy go. In unrelated news, I doubted it would last, but a year later and
  Global Dan's "Dark Out"
  is still a certified banger lol.

          Dua Lipa - Love Again</a></li>

        <p>
        Dua Lipa deserves mentioning because her album had so many hits on her album that she deserved representation 
        on the list, even if I don't have a clear-cut favorite from the album. 
        I think at least 7 of the 11 tracks have been my favorite at some point and "Love Again" landed 
        on top when it came to list-making time. Of all the tracks, this feels like the most 80sish throwbackish 
        of the bunch. And the beat, weird as it might be, hits pretty hard and has grown to be my favorite 
        on the album. The whole 
        album slaps though so you could have thrown a dart at the tracklist and been able to justify its inclusion
        on this list.

        I actually discovered this song while waching a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HeL2V4BJjA">Tony Hawk Pro Skater 
          YouTube video</a>. And while the song did not inspire me to pull off a 2080 million point combo like 
          the author of the video, it did introduce me to a high-energy, garage-rock jam. That's where music 
          discovery is in 2020.

          Lupe Fiasco - Dinosaurs</a></li>
            <img width="40%" src="../static/images/Year_End_Recaps/2020/house.jpg">
        </center>
      </br>
        <p>
        A purely lyrical exercise for the sake of lyrical exercises, Dinosaurs is another expression 
        of how Lupe Fiasco has continued to level up his skills over the years. One ever-so-slight criticism 
        that I've had about Lupe's later work is just how serious and deliberate and impenetrable his lyrical 
        delivery has been, as if it the lyrics are buckling under the weight of all the thought that went into 
        them. The lightheartedness of Dinosaurs' subject matter frees up Lupe to take up a free-wheeling, 
        conversational flow over a beat so abstract that most rappers wouldn't know where to start with. 
        It's a the tightrope of making the track sound easy, but also making it lyrically dense so that the 
        listener picks up a new rhyme or nugget with each listen. The degree of difficulty is on full display 
        and it's a marvel to listen to.

          Charli XCX - Forever</a></li>
            <img width="40%" src="../static/images/Year_End_Recaps/2020/forever.jpg">
        </center>
      </br>
        <p>
        COVID-19's impact on popular culture and music was inescapeable and overwhelmingly not good.
        Whether it was top-tier artists (@Kendrick Lamar) delaying albums due to an inability to tour to 
        every rapper trying their darndest to force in words that rhymed with "coronavirus" into 
        their verses, the unsolicited urge to react to COVID-19 was one of 2020 music's more annoying subplots.
        </p>

        <p>Yet of all the artists who felt compelled to relate their material to COVID-19, Charli XCX's anthem 
          'Forever' comes across as the most tasteful attempt by far. 'Forever' is a love song for those who are 
          separated by the quarantine. It conveys the feeling of every romantic and familial relationship 
          that just became long-distance. While we can't hug on Zoom, we still have so much life to live 
          together, even if we're not in the same room.
        </p>

        <center><li id="announcelist"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOgI5qsAB4w">
          Dorian Electra - F The World (feat. The Garden, Quay Dash & d0llywood1)</a></li>
            <img width="40%" src="../static/images/Year_End_Recaps/2020/my_agenda.jpg">
        </center>
      </br>
        <p>
        Perhaps the most "extra" song that I heard all year. From the hyperdrive production 
       to the edgy dark theme, this song is out of control. Once you get to Quay Dash's verse,
       there's a surreal, novel feeling that you're in uncharted waters.
        </p>

        <p>Thematically, this track is a not so subtle satirization of "toxic masculinity."
          The album's concept portrays a man closed off from society, feeling an intense
          anger at what the world has become, yet still feeling a vulnerable craving to connect 
          with others. I'll discuss a little more in the "Albums of the Year" but just know 
          from the lyrics it's more of a "love"/hate relationship rather than just hate.
        </p>

        <p>And yet, despite its in-your-face production and chorus, it's the little hints and "chef's kiss" 
          production flourishes that make the track. This is hard to describe, but there's 
          specifically a little horn-like "bur br brr, br br br" that is pleasing to the ear. 
          It's just indicative of how much effort went into this track and how much thought Dorian 
          Electra puts into their music.

        This song has my favorite chorus that I heard this year. The chorus is just so sweet and warm and
        I liken it to a flower blooming before your eyes, even though that same warmth and coziness just 
        makes you want to curl 
        up under a blanket in front of a fireplace. It's summer and fall at the same time, and one of my 
        favorite songs to listen to and just feel good.

          100 Gecs - ringtone (Remix) (feat. Charli XCX, Kero Kero Bonito, and Rico Nasty)</a></li>
            <img width="40%" src="../static/images/Year_End_Recaps/2020/ringtone.jpg">
        </center>
      </br>
        <p>
        The more time that goes by, the more convinced I am that 100 Gecs' debut album "1000 Gecs," 
        is a classic. That release was a Big Bang (or Big Gec, if you will) that made the "Hyperpop" 
        genre one of the hottest underground movements in music right now. Its zany, distorted pop excess 
        has paved the way for smaller artists such as Dorian Electra while also influencing rising pop stars 
        with actual name recognition like Charli XCX. 
        </p>

      <p>I say all that because the magnitude of Gecs' influence didn't occur to me until this song 
        dropped and I looked at the feature list. Sure, Charli XCX, KKB and Rico Nasty aren't all pop 
        superstars (although Charli's getting close), but this is the 100 Gecs' equivalent of that 'Forever'
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDuRoPIOBjE">song</a> about LeBron James which had Drake, 
        Kanye West, Lil Wayne and Eminem all on the same track purely for the hype.
      </p>

      <p>Because 'ringtone' remix is no longer a quaint, wholesome love 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugOvPjtlnxs">song</a>; it's now a posse track. Ironically,
        Sarah Bonito from Kero Kero Bonito, who's whole brand is built around wholesomeness, is here to drop 
        some bars. It's a complete reimagining of what the original song, and what a remix in general, can be. 
        While I go to sleep every night in fear that the Hyperpop bubble is going to pop any day now, 
        it's this song specifically that keeps me warm knowing that the genre has legs.
      </p>

          Juice WRLD - Man of the Year</a></li>
            <img width="40%" src="../static/images/Year_End_Recaps/2020/juice_WRLD.png">
        </center>
      </br>
        <p>
        *Please note: There are two versions of this song. I much prefer the original which is not the
        one streaming on Spotify. Please click the hyperlink above or visit YouTube if you want to hear this 
        original version.*
        </p>

        <p>Juice WRLD was my favorite artist in 2019, and the news of his untimely passing a year ago 
          is the hardest I've taken a celebrity death, for what it's worth. While I was initially mildly 
          disappointed in listening through the first 20 tracks of Juice WRLD's posthumous album this last 
          song made the whole listening experience more that worth it.
        </p>

        <p>And while I can't give a musical justification for this song being this high on the list - it's 
          a happy-go-lucky tune that may come across as cheesy in other contexts - something about this 
          song hit me emotionally hard. "Man of the Year" expresses the joy of his music foiled by a 
          few lyrics hinting at how emotionally troubled Jarad (Juice WRLD) Higgins appeared to be. 
          It's a microcosm of what 
          makes his tragedy hard to stomach, even as his posthumous songs were predicting 
          it left and right.
        </p>

        <p>Although bittersweet, "Man of the Year" is one last happy goodbye from a truly talented artist. 
          Rest in peace, Jarad.

        <p>
        Born from Gec, molded by memes, fired through the brimstone of 2020, Gupi and Fraxiom 
        (known together as the group "food house") rose through the ashes with the sole purpose of stretching
        the "Hyperpop" genre to it's only logical, insane conclusion. Or actually they're probably 
      just buddies that had a free Saturday and messed around making music and seeing what stuck. It's 
      probably the latter. Still, they somehow hit gold.</p>
        
        <p>At its heart,
        "Thos Moser" is a wholesome pop song centered around organizing a spontaneous meeting with 
        that special someone in your life. If you try to dig any deeper, you'll be met with distortion,
      random lyrics about Elon Musk, and overall immature silliness.</p>

        <p>But man does the music sound good. Fraxiom's vocal inflections combined with Gupi's dynamic 
          production just make for fun, zany, catchy songs. Also, the end of "Mos Thoser" was the biggest 
          musical plot twist I've heard in a while.
        </p>
        <p>One thing to not my past lists of favorite songs/albums have been historically heavy on 
          hip-hop/rap. In 2020, my listening habits are way different. Part of it is all the top established 
          rap artists (*cough cough Kendrick, Kanye, J Cole, all of TDE, Drake to a certain extent, Travis Scott 
          is now a McDonald's/PS5/Nike salesman) 
          basically punted to 2021 due to COVID. But part of it is because the Gecsverse has totally sucked 
          me in. Shout out to Gupi and Fraxiom for helping save 2020 for me. 
        </p>
<p>
        *Fun Fact: Gupi is Tony Hawk's son lol.

              Hand Crushed By A Mallet - 100 Gecs (Fallout Boy Remix)</a></li>

          </br>
         
          <p>So I'm listening to the new 100 Gecs remix album for the first time while walking through 
            the grocery store with my mask on. It's not my usual grocery store, so tracking down all of 
            the produce in an unfamiliar store is a real pain. I'm taking a 3rd loop around because I'm 
            looking for shallots and my pride won't let myself ask for help and
          </p>

          <p>wait... is that.. Fallout Boy?? Am I listening to the right song? "Oh, hello sir, sorry to bother you, 
            but I have a soup recipe that I'm working on an do you know where
            I could possibly find some Fallout Boy?" (DAMNIT)
          </p>
          <p>As I walked in shame to see that the shallots were right behind the cherry tomatoes and that I 
            had passed them four times, I could not help but smile at the smirk. Not because sheer 
            ridiculousness of the feature choice, but because it fit 

          </p>
                
                  <p>Much like the 'ringtone' remix discussed earlier, 100 Gecs takes a very liberal interpretation 
                  on what a remix can be. They turn what was a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJhb43oLbDs"> 
                    hyperdrive electronic 
                  music banger</a> into the slow-developing emo-punk Fallout Boy anthem it apparently was always 
                  destined to be.
                  Once Patrick Stump takes over the track around 1:27 (my favorite musical moment of 2020), 
                  nobody is safe, and the world is better off for it.
            </p>

            <p>And even then, I still have trouble deciding between this 'hand crushed' remix and the also excellent 
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJcnrDMaSBA">N0thanky0u Remix</a> that seems to 
              operate on the assumption that the Fallout Boy remix didn't go nearly hard enough. I guess I finally 
              get the appeal of metal music now. I kind of wish that 
              I could take the intro from the N0thanky0u remix, take the middle to end of the Fallout Boy remix, and 
              somehow incorporate the EDM beat from the original all into one giant Franken-song.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sorry I wasn't sure if I had enough 100 Gecs-type representation on my list.

            <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
          </br>
            <p>2020 had a lot of terrible surprises. While music didn't 
              make up any of that gap, I think it was a year where a lot of great music came from 
              unexpected places. Who knew that Dua Lipa would become pop music's quarantine overlord overnight? 
              Who knew that that Chinese app called TikTok would have so much influence on which songs 
              topped the Billboard charts? Who knew that three of the biggest rap albums of 2020 (Mac Miller, 
              Pop Smoke, and
              Juice WRLD), would be posthumous releases and that it would have some of each artist's 
              best songs?</p>
              
              <p>In an unconventional year, the stage was cleared for some unconventional 
              artists to shine. They filled in admirably in what was supposed to be a "down" year. And with a 
              light at the end of the tunnel and several gigabytes of highly anticipated, unreleased music on deck, 
              2021 is going to be loaded.</p>
