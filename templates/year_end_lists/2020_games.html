   <p>Playing video games got weird in 2020. Or at least wrting about them did. How does one convince an audience
       that a game called "Doom Eternal" has an awesome vibe in a year where vibes are decidely not awesome?
       How does a gamer through the zombie apocalypse of "The Last of Us Part II" after spending all day
       navigating the obstacles of a pandemic life? How do I present a game called "Hades" where you spend 
       90% of your time fighting demons in the Underworld and convince you that it's really a heartwarming
       story about family?(it really is!)
   </p>

   <p>The fact is, none of these uncomfortable parallels to real life likely registered with gamers around
       the world. I mean, it likely did spend a few seconds in our consciousness, but didn't really affect our
       enjoyment of the game, or what we thought about the game itself. Sure, there are plenty of people who
       opted to play Animal Crossing: New Horizons for what I assumed to be a lighthearted, decorative adventure.
       However, if dark, heavy, high-stakes narrative games are your preferred flavor of escapism, 
       2020 likely didn't change that.
   </p>

   <p>And while a lot of the games that I played fit into that dark, edgy mold, I found myself more
       interested in exploring the intricate worlds of these games rather than fighting the demons that
       inhabited them. A common theme of these games is their ability to tell a story, whether that's
       through visuals, dialogue, or just plain old action.
   </p>

   
          <p>Before we get to that, I asked my brother Michael for his top-5 board games of 2020.
            A lot of these games came out in recent years, and these were his favorites for the year.
          </p>
        
          <p><h2>Michael's Favorite Board Games in 2020:</h2></p>

          <p><ol>
            <li>Spirit Island</li>
            <li>Scythe</li>
            <li>Root Underworld Expansion</li>
            <li>Pandemic Legacy Season 2</li>
            <li>Gloomhaven</li>
          </ol></p>

          <p><h2>Cyberpunk 2077 on PS4 Early Thoughts:</h2></p><p>Also, some quick thoughts after
            playing a few hours of the game on base PS4. The game has been getting crushed online 
            for having a multitude of bugs and performance issues, especially on last-generation consoles
            like PS4, even to the point where it's been taken down from the PS4 online stores.
          </p>

          <p>I personally have a high tolerance when it comes to bugs, even ones where I've seen unmanned 
            motorcycles randomly taking flight and doing barrel rolls in the air. The load times are kinda
            brutal though, and the framerate gets somewhat choppy whenever you're in combat.
          </p>

          <p>Yet most of the "jank" in Cyberpunk derives from its Fallout styled design and gameplay.
            It's clear that the designers focused on making this the biggest, baddest world and progression
            system, and thus, the day-to-day enemy AI behavior in this massive world isn't as smooth as it
            might be if they game designers had the bandwidth to focus on it. I don't hate it, I'm having
            a lot of dumb fun running around and whacking people with my baseball bat as enemies miss with their
            slow, inaccurate melee attacks.
          </p>
          <p>Long story short, the progression system, world, and flexibility to attack any scenario a variety
            of different ways make Cyberpunk a diamond in the rough, but there's a lot of rough that you have
            to turn a blind eye to unfortunately.
          </p>

          <p>Ok, I might actually get to the list let's go:</p>

        <center><li id="announcelist">Ghost of Tsushima</li>
            <img width="50%" src="../static/images/Year_End_Recaps/2020/ghost.jpg">
        </center>
      </br>
        <p>
              Ghost of Tsushima does just enough to refresh the "Assassin's Creed-Like 3rd Person Action"
              game to stand out in what has become an oversaturated genre. Its sword combat is at worst, second-best
              to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and its internal conflict of fighting honorably vs. fighting
            dirty in the face of overwhelming odds is definitely off the beaten path for Western video games.
            There's only so much the game can do to guilt you for using the dishonorable tactics that you've
            used in every game ever (see Cyberpunk, baseball bat), but it made me think for a couple seconds I
            guess.
        </p>

        <p>The real selling point for Ghost of Tsushima is its incredible, and apparently relatively accurate
          recreation of Tsushima, Japan. It may be the most beautiful setting and lighting I've seen in
          a game. The game knows this, and takes full advantage of it. You are encouraged to meditate, write a haiku, 
          and collect numerous awesome clothing outfits and headbands as you add to your legend. For what it's 
          worth, Ghost of Tsushima has the Aesthetics Championship Belt for 2020, and it's going to be a tall
          order for any game to wrestle that title away.
        </p>
    
                <p>
        <center><li id="announcelist">Hades</li>
            <img width="50%" src="../static/images/Year_End_Recaps/2020/hades.jpg">
        </center>
      </br>
        <p>
                Whereas Ghost of Tsushima builds its world through incredible visuals, Hades' world is built
              through its relationships between the different gods in its household. You play as Zagreus, a 
              demigod with daddy issues. Only your dad is Hades, Lord of the Dead. As you go through all of the trouble 
              to fight Hell's legions to run away from hell, you'll get blessings and boons from Zeus, Poseidon 
              and the like in an attempt for them to spite your dad/their brother. The interdynamics of this 
              petty, celestial household expressed over 20,000 unique dialogue lines in the game is the true 
              draw of the game, even more so than its compelling diverse combat scenarios. 
            </p>

            <p>The game starts as a perfectly polished 10/10 that's sin is that it doesn't have enough 
              combat to keep up with its dialogue. You only have dialogue in between runs, but after 
              30+ runs, the combat loop gets somewhat stale even though there's still plenty of story 
              to get to. But while grinding for dialogue in the endgame soured a seemingly perfect game, 
              Hades' first 20-30 hours are such an addictive thrill-ride which makes it the indie game of 
              the year.
            </p>
    
                <p>

        <center><li id="announcelist">The Last of Us Part II</li>
            <img width="50%" src="../static/images/Year_End_Recaps/2020/TLOU2.jpg">
        </center>
        <p>
                Sure, this game has been polarizing. Sure, the developers likely would have be better served 
                to turn down the darkness and brutality 20-30%. It's a long, dark, edgy, unforgiving game trying to 
                follow-up possibly 
                one of the greatest games of all-time. Of course it's going to turn off some people. And while the sheer heaviness of the material is going to attract thousands of internet 
                nitpickers, the zombies and violence distract from what makes this game so enthralling.
              </p>
    
              <p>This may be hard to explain, but true joy of The Last of Us 2 isn't its combat or its story, 
                but exploring the world when nobody is around. Every nook and cranny in the 
                game is uniquely and meticulously designed with love and care from the game's visual designers, 
                portraying an aura of mystery to the world that came before. The joy is walking through an abandoned 
                tattoo parlor, a hotel weightroom, a high-rise apartment building, rummaging for loot and imagining 
                the lives of its past residents. It's walking past the dining room and doing a double-take to 
                see a full blown Dungeons and Dragons spread on the table.
              </p>
            
                   <center> <img width="50%" src="../static/images/Year_End_Recaps/2020/DND.jpg"> </center>

            <p>Sometimes it's a little too much, the developers didn't have to create a full-blown 
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8lyyjFB0xg">whistling language</a> for one of the tribes 
              factions. The try-hard nature of the game sometimes works against itself, as certain scenes 
              and sections could've probably been cut.
            </p>
            <p>So while the developers at Naughty Dog didn't quite make The Godfather II, they made possibly 
              the most immersive experience that I've ever played. It's the best you can expect for a 
              game with this much ambition, and definitely a worthwhile successor to its classic predecessor. 
              While I likely will never play it again, it's still an easy 9.5/10.
            </p>

        <center><li id="announcelist">Doom Eternal</li>
            <img width="50%" src="../static/images/Year_End_Recaps/2020/doom_eternal.jpg">
        </center>

      </br>
        <p>
                Doom Eternal is EASILY the best first person shooter that I have ever played. While I'm 
                no FPS expert, Doom Eternal's emphasis on mobility and movement is such a refreshing twist on
                a genre that often incentivizes players to "camp" behind cover and play conservatively. 
        </p>

                <p>
                There are places to run in Doom Eternal, but there is nowhere to hide. In boxed stages full 
                of demons designed like a glorified laser-tag arena, you will undoubtedly take damage. The question
                is whether or not you can deal more damage (and get the requisite health for defeating enemies) than
                you take. The delicate balance of life and death combined with the constant need to stay on
                the move makes nearly every moment of Doom Eternal's gameplay a quick-twitch adrenaline rush.
                </p>

                <p>
                Also refreshing is the absurd story, which doesn't take itself seriously at all. The big bads have
                an existential fear of you, knowing that the demonic legions of Hell do not stand a 
                chance against the singular Doom Slayer. And for good reason, there's a mission where you use
                a super-laser to blow a giant hole into Mars and then you use that same laser to unnecessarily
                shoot yourself into Mars' core as a shortcut. Because why not. The only drawback is that the actually 
                pretty interesting, lore is unfortunately relegated to optionally readable codexes.
                </p>

                <p>The DLC is lit although gratuitously difficult. Overall, Doom Eternal is essentially
                  John Wick with a double jump crossed with lazer tag, what's not to like?
                </p>

        <center> <li id="announcelist">Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1+2 (Remake)</li>
            <img width="50%" src="../static/images/Year_End_Recaps/2020/tony_hawk.jpg">
       </center>
      </br>
    
        <p>
            I may get flack for this, but THPS remake was pound-for-pound, the most fun I had playing
            a game this year. Every level is a 2-minute race to complete challenges and rack up as high of a
            score as possible using 4 wheels, a piece of plywood, and whatever tricks you have in your bag.</p>

            <p>
            The skill curve is relatively steep and the process of going from being unable to 
            consistently pull of a normal grind trick to pulling off 20-trick, 100,000 point combos is a mechanically
            difficult, but rewarding
            one. And by mechanically difficult, I mean I was button mashing until the outside foam on my analog stick
            started wearing off. It's the ever elusive chase of bailing and resetting time after time to pull off that one
            perfect combo that makes THPS and its ever growing list of challenges so replayable, even when you've
            beaten the game. 
        </p>
        <p>So while the total content you'll get out of the THPS remake barely stretches past 30 hours, it's nice
            to see that not every game has to be a 60-hour post-apocalyptic open-world saga that's
            trying to be the next Shakespearean tragedy. Sure, the elevated level of storytelling going into these
            games is much appreciated, and very much my cup of tea. But the sheer simplicity of X+Square+Triangle+X+R2+R2+Up+Down
            (Ollie + Kickflip + 50-50 grind + Ollie + Acid Drop + Revert + BS Manual) is a good reminder that not everything 
            has to be doom and gloom in 2020.
